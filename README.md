# A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for SQL Injection Detection in E-commerce Platforms
This is a research I conducted during my graduate degree in Management Information Systems at the University of Illinois at Springfield. It evaluates the efficacy of various machine learning algorithms in identifying SQL injection (SQLi) attempts, to strengthen the cybersecurity measures of e-commerce platforms against these common threats.

#  Research Study Highlights: 
SQL Injection Detection in E-Commerce

#  Focus: 
Detection of SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks within e-commerce platforms.
#  Importance: 
Ensuring the security of e-commerce systems against invasive SQLi attacks.
#  Objective: 
Evaluate the efficacy of various machine learning algorithms in identifying SQLi attempts.

#  Machine Learning Models Compared

    Logistic Regression
    Random Forest
    Naïve Bayes
    Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

#  Methodology

- Utilized a dataset of SQL queries labeled as malicious or non-malicious.
- Models trained and tested based on:
        Accuracy
        Precision
        Recall
        F1 Score
        Area under the ROC Curve

#  Key Findings

Random Forest: Outperformed other models, balancing precision and recall effectively.
Logistic Regression: High precision but lower recall.
Naïve Bayes: Efficient in processing speed but lower overall detection capability.
ANN: Significant potential with adaptability, closely rivaling Random Forest, but requires complex tuning.

#  Additional Insights

    Impact of data balancing on model performance, with some models showing decreased accuracy post-balancing.
    Importance of considering dataset characteristics in model training and evaluation.

#  Recommendations

    Further exploration of hybrid models and deep learning techniques.
    Focus on real-time detection systems.
    Expand dataset diversity to include novel SQLi techniques.
    Validate model effectiveness across various cybersecurity contexts.

This research contributes to the development of more secure digital commerce environments by leveraging machine learning to combat SQL injection threats.
